In order to run the soccer team:
1. Add the files CarAISoccer_gr1.cs, Move.cs, Navigator.cs and SoccerV1.BT.txt to Assets/Scripts in your Unity project.
2. Assign the CarAISoccer_gr1.cs as script for the teamplayers (this step can be a bit tricky, I added new cars manually and stopped the game manager from generating new cars...). 
3. Install Panda BT to the Unity project.
4. Add the SoccerV1.BT.text panda script to all the players (see Petters instruction video for steps 3 and 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHgxZA7ejDg&t=409s)
5. Start the Game if all succeds (RIP)
